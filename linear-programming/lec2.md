# Whoa, lecture 2! (Poggers)

Lecture 2 starts out with some sample simplex stuff. It performs some pivoting steps - nothing new.

You just express the entering variable in terms of the leaving variable using basic algebra, and then
sub in the newly gotten expression for the entering variable all the places it's used. You then get
(from subbing in the new equation into the other basic variables' equations) new equations for all
the other basic variables that now contain no references to the entering variable, but instead ref-
erences the leaving one.
