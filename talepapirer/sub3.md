# Network Flow Models and Flow Algorithms

Based on lectures 3 (second part), 4, 5 (part about LP duality), 6, 7, 8.

- 3: Duality
- 4: Duality, (strict/non-strict) complementary slackness, Farkas' Lemma
- 5: Some proofs, weak/strong duality theorem
- 6: Game theory.
- 7: ILP, Branch-and-Bound.
- 8: Branch-and-Bound, Branch-and-Cut.

## Overview of the presentation

Present dictionaries, duality. What is complementary slackness, what can we
conclude with it? ILP. LP-relaxations. Branch-and-Cut, cutting planes (that one
theorem for it, can't remember LMOA).
