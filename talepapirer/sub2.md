# LP Duality, Matrix Games, and Integer linear programming

Based on lectures 3 (second part), 4, 5 (part about duality), 6, 7, 8.

- 3: Duality.
- 4: Duality, complementary slackness, Farkas' lemma and strict complementarity.
- 5: Lil' bit about duality.
- 6: Game theory.
- 7: ILP, Branch-and-Bound.
- 8: Branch-and-Bound, Branch-and-Cut.

## Overview of the presentation

First, what is LP? Simplex? (Those should be quick.) Then explain how to get the
dual. Give properties about the dual problem (not necessarily Farkas', don't
really wanna go in that direction). Then start on ILP. LP relaxations.
Branch-and-Cut. Cutting planes.
