# The linear programming model and LP algorithms

Based on lectures 1, 2, 3 (first part), 5 (simplex impl part), 14

- 1: The linear programming problem.
- 2: Analysis of the Simplex algorithm, two-phase simplex.
- 3: Two-phase simplex, analysis.
- 5: Implementation issues for the simplex method.
- 14: Ellipsoid and interior point algorithms. General convex quad programming,
  general convex programming.

## Overview of the presentation

First, talk about what linear programming is. Introduce general, standard form.
Then introduce dictionaries. Then explain the simplex algorithm.
Origo-infeasible? Oh no! Bam: Auxiliary problem. Two-phase simplex. Lastly, an
overview of the ellipsoid and interior point algorithms.
