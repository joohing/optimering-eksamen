# P, NP, and Cook's theorem

Based on lectures 15, 16, 17, 18.

- 15: Turing machines, efficiency, P.
- 16: NP, reductions, NPC.
- 17: (circuit) SAT, Bool func representations, truth tables formulas and circuits.
- 18: Cook's theorem

## Overview of the presentation

What's a turing machine. What is efficiency. The class of P. NP and reductions.
What is a language, decision problems. Polynomial-time computable maps. How to
reduce some sample thing to SAT.
