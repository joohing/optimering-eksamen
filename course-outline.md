The course covers the following materials. These will (maybe?) be
filled out over time.

---------------------- Linear programming -------------------------
	Simplex algorithm for finding optimal solutions to
	systems of equations with linear constraints.

	Interior point methods, where you don't necessarily
	walk along the edges of the polyhedron.

	Duality, where maximisation and minimization are
	basically the same.

	Matrix games, where you have a row minimizer (most often,
	the row player is the maximizer!) and a column maximizer,
	and you model it as an LP problem where the problems of
	the players are each other's duals.

---------------------- Flow networks -------------------------
	Max flow, where you analyse different algorithms
	for finding the maximum flow through a system, and
	min flow, the opposite.

	Costs of systems, where you add together all the
	costs of the edges between vertices such that e.g.
	it is minimized.

---------------------- Integer programming -------------------------
	Programming with integers. Just kidding, LOL!
	Don't really know what this one is about.

------------------------- Complexity theory -------------------------
	P vs NP and related classes. Concrete problems
	are analyzed w.r.t. their respective NP-hardness.

------------------------- Coping with NP-hardness -------------------------
	How to cope with the fact that either NP is just
	hard or we haven't found the solution yet. Approx-
	imation algorithms.
